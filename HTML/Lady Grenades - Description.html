			<em>Lady Grenades</em> is used to call attention to how our society genders virtually everything, and often in a simple generic way such as color coding. Much in the same way hardware stores will color power tools pink in order to market to women, I have colored one grenade a vibrant pink. The second has subtle flashes of pink incorporated into the rustic patina. The pink grenade stands out in contrast to the other pieces as a metaphor for the obvious instances of sexism. The second grenade calls attention to more subtle instances of sexism within our society, those which often go unnoticed, but are not without consequence. Due to the ubiquitous presence of the media within our culture, it has the ability to affect us on a subconscious level, which can at times be harder to combat then the more obvious forms of sexism.
