			Recently my work has been comprised of raised and formed copper vessels that conceptually address gender roles in America. Repetition of hostile text becomes a commentary regarding women's position in society and questions the validity of stereotypes. The media subconsciously, and consciously affects society's notion of femininity often creating a stigma. I draw on personal experiences and feminist theory by investigating the perception of women within American culture, and how this image has perverted my own ideas of self-worth.

			I am interested in the sociological effects of mass media within western culture, and the ways in which it effects societies understanding of women. Upon inspection of the media one will start to realize that the portrayal of women is not entirely accurate, and often paints an ugly picture. Only a small portion of our society is represented within the media while it claims to represent actuality with scripted, planned, and anything but factual reality TV shows. Coupled with unattainable societal standards for beauty, the media can be detrimental to a woman's concept of self-respect. Media has the ability to play a significant role in the socialization of youth. Young girls find role models and idols within the media, and the value of these women is often correlated with their appearance, teaching them this is how to measures a woman's merit.

			My work questions the ways in which we value women, and create expectations based on presumed stereotypes. My work blends masculine and feminine symbols and inverse color coding to disrupt the ability to categorize the object as masculine or feminine, weakening the power of the label. The text manifests in a variety of forms to mimic the many avenues in which the media has access to people.  Mirrors are also hidden within the vessels, surprising the viewer with their reflection, serving as a reminder to look within, revaluing spiritual development and introspection.

			The ubiquitous nature of the media within modern culture enforces its relevance as a subject within contemporary artwork and feminist theory. Through my work I wish to raise awareness of the influence of the media, and it's inaccurate representation of women. Mass media creates and implements stereotypes, both negative and positive.
