		<h1>About the Artist</h1>
		
		<hr>
		
		<p>Brianne Beecroft is a Denver based artist with a BFA from Metropolitan State University of Denver with an emphasis in jewelry design and metalsmithing. Brianne works primarily with metal, but also works two dimensionally using colored pencils, pen, and graphite. She uses her artwork in order to investigate social issues and create a commentary on them. Her work is heavily research based, as well as a reflection of personal experience. Women's issues are a common topic, often derived from experiences in male dominated fields of work and athleticism. Brianne is an active participant in the Colorado parkour community, and when not making artwork can be found practicing parkour, hiking or mountain biking.
