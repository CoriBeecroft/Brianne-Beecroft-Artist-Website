		<h1>My Story</h1>
		<hr>
		<p>
			My most visceral high-school experiences were the moments just after teachers announced we were to work in groups. My heart would race, and sweat would form. In a few short minutes it would be apparent to the entire class that I had no friends. After graduation I had no intention of continuing my education. High-school was a nightmare and I saw no reason to perpetuate the experience. I found my place among a motley bunch of punk rockers and metal heads, and was able to find some degree of self confidence. I worked a string of unfulfilling restaurant jobs, but nonetheless easily excelled into management. Three years post high-school my life was dedicated to maintaining the facade of a "badass chick," fawning over boys with tattoos and mohawks, and spending every spare cent on concerts. I weighed 95 lbs, smoked cigarettes, and was incredibly unhealthy.

			I became fed up with this empty lifestyle of superficial relationships and people -- it was time to move on. I decided to go back to school and studying art was the only thing made sense. The return to school was stimulating and instilled me with a determination and a desire to learn. I quit smoking in my first semester, started eating well, began exercising, and quickly regained a healthy weight.  I never missed a class, as this was the most interesting thing I had done in years. I couldn't focus on the academic part of school growing up because I could never get past the social pressure. With age and experience, I gained perspective and newfound confidence in my abilities.
