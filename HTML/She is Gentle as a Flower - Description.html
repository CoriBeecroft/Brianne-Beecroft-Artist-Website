		<p>
			<em>She is Gentle as a Flower</em> fuses delicate feminine shapes with a harsh texture and heat patina. This piece has become a manifestation of the frustration I have felt when encountering these issues in my day to day life.  I created holes and texture with the use of nitric acid creating an aggressive display of emotion.
