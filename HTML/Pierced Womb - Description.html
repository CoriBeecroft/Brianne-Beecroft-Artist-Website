		<p>
		<em>Pierced Womb</em> serves as a symbol for femininity, historically the first figures of women displayed pronounced bellies and reproductive organs equating women with childbirth. Within modern society our culture overvalues external factors causing women to search for the solution to problems in superficial things linked to appearance and the ability to attract men. The mirror contained within the vessel is meant to surprise the viewer with their own reflection and in turn encourage introspection.
