			<em>His Perfect Woman</em> is a violent embodiment of the idealized body within mass media. The media constantly projects images of photo-shopped, enhanced, perfect women creating an unattainable standard which can be damaging to women and girls. This piece was an reflection of my own feelings of inadequacy, and my struggle with resurfacing insecurities in relationships. Within the media women are primarily valued for their appearance, and those that don't fit within the beauty standard can experience feelings of diminished self worth. This over-emphasis of appearance within the media causes many women to look at external factors for the source of their problems. The text within the figure represents a woman's internalization of negative stereotypes, simultaneously questioning their presence within our society.
